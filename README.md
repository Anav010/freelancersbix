🚀 Company Website – Full Stack Project (MEN Stack)

This repository contains the complete source code for a full-stack company website that I designed, developed, and deployed end-to-end. The project was built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, delivering a responsive, scalable, and production-ready web application.

📋 Project Overview

The application is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and easy to maintain, while supporting real-world use cases such as showcasing company information, services, contact forms, and more.
